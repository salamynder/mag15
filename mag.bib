The author also addresses a series of grammatical changes and innovations caused by the formation of this resultative construction, such as the development of aspect, mood, verb reduplication, the new predicate structure, the disposal construction, the passive construction, the verb copying construction, and the new topicalization construction, all of which together shape the grammatical system of Modern Chinese. The present analysis raises and discusses a number of theoretical issues that are meaningful to various linguistic disciplines like pragmatics, discourse analysis, grammaticalization, and general historical linguistics.},

The main emphasis of this series is on self-contained monographs covering particular areas of recent research and surveys of methods, problems, and results in all fields of inquiry where recourse to logical analysis and logical methods has been fruitful. {INDICES} will contain monographs dealing with the central areas of philosophical logic (extensional and intensional systems, indexical logics, non-classical logics, philosophy of logic, etc.) as well as studies in which these systems are applied to specific issues in philosophy, in the formal semantics of natural languages, the foundations of linguistic theory, in computational linguistics, and in theoretical computer science. Constructive type theory was first presented in 1970, by the Swedish logician Per Martin-Lof. It has become one of the main approaches used in the foundations of mathematics and computer science. But it has remained relatively unknown among linguists and philosophers, although it provides a considerable extension of the concepts and techniques of logic. The book first gives an introduction to type theory from the point of view of linguistics and the philosophy of language. Type theory is then applied in the areas of quantification, anaphora, temporal reference, and the structure of text and discourse. By virtue of the type-theoretical concepts of proof object and context, various phenomena of dependence and progression in language can be discussed in precise terms, and several well-known problems can be solved. A categorial grammar is presented togenerate formally a fragment of English, together with an example of a computer implementation.},

	abstract = {Grammatical Framework ({GF}) is a special-purpose functional language for defining grammars. It uses a Logical Framework ({LF}) for a description of abstract syntax, and adds to this a notation for defining concrete syntax. {GF} grammars themselves are purely declarative, but can be used both for linearizing syntax trees and parsing strings. {GF} can describe both formal and natural languages. The key notion of this description is a grammatical object, which is not just a string, but a record that contains all information on inflection and inherent grammatical features such as number and gender in natural languages, or precedence in formal languages. Grammatical objects have a type system, which helps to eliminate run-time errors in language processing. In the same way as a {LF}, {GF} uses dependent types in abstract syntax to express semantic conditions, such as well-typedness and proof obligations. Multilingual grammars, where one abstract syntax has many parallel concrete syntaxes, can be used for reliable and meaning-preserving translation. They can also be used in authoring systems, where syntax trees are constructed in an interactive editor similar to proof editors based on {LF}. While being edited, the trees can simultaneously be viewed in different languages. This paper starts with a gradual introduction to {GF}, going through a sequence of simpler formalisms till the full power is reached. The introduction is followed by a systematic presentation of the {GF} formalism and outlines of the main algorithms: partial evaluation and parser generation. The paper concludes by brief discussions of the Haskell implementation of {GF}, existing applications, and related work.},

	abstract = {A Systran {MT} server became available on the minitel network in 1984, and on Internet in 1994. Since then we have come to a better understanding of the nature of {MT} systems by separately analyzing their linguistic, computational, and operational architectures. Also, thanks to the {CxAxQ} metatheorem, the systems' inherent limits have been clarified, and design choices can now be made in an informed manner according to the translation situations. {MT} evaluation has also matured: tools based on reference translations are useful for measuring progress; those based on subjective judgments for estimating future usage quality; and task-related objective measures (such as post-editing distances) for measuring operational quality. Moreover, the same technological advances that have led to “Web 2.0” have brought several futuristic predictions to fruition. Free Web {MT} services have democratized assimilation {MT} beyond belief. Speech translation research has given rise to usable systems for restricted tasks running on {PDAs} or on mobile phones connected to servers. New man-machine interface techniques have made interactive disambiguation usable in large-coverage multimodal {MT}. Increases in computing power have made statistical methods workable, and have led to the possibility of building low-linguistic-quality but still useful {MT} systems by machine learning from aligned bilingual corpora ({SMT}, {EBMT}). In parallel, progress has been made in developing interlingua-based {MT} systems, using hybrid methods. Unfortunately, many misconceptions about {MT} have spread among the public, and even among {MT} researchers, because of ignorance of the past and present of {MT} R\&D. A compensating factor is the willingness of end users to freely contribute to building essential parts of the linguistic knowledge needed to construct {MT} systems, whether corpus-related or lexical. Finally, some developments we anticipated fifteen years ago have not yet materialized, such as online writing - - tools equipped with interactive disambiguation, and as a corollary the possibility of transforming source documents into self-explaining documents ({SEDs}) and of producing corresponding {SEDs} fully automatically in several target languages. These visions should now be realized, thanks to the evolution of Web programming and multilingual {NLP} techniques, leading towards a true Semantic Web, “Web 3.0”, which will support ubilingual (ubiquitous multilingual) computing.},

This book is a systematic and structured exploration of the linguistic devices that Mandarin Chinese employs to express aspectual meanings. The work presented here is the first corpus-based account of aspect in Chinese, encompassing both situation aspect and viewpoint aspect. In using corpus data, the book seeks to achieve a marriage between theory-driven and corpus-based approaches to linguistics. The corpus-based model presented explores aspect at both the semantic and grammatical levels. At the semantic level a two-level model of situation aspect is proposed, which covers both the lexical and sentential levels, thus giving a better account of the compositional nature of situation aspect. At the grammatical level four perfective and four imperfective aspects in Chinese are explored in detail. This exploration corrects many intuition-based misconceptions, and associated misleading conclusions, about aspect in Chinese common in the literature.},
