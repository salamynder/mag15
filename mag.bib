	shorttitle = {The Establishment of Modern Chinese Grammar},
	abstract = {This book investigates historical motivations for the emergence of the resultative construction in Chinese from the following four aspects: (a) disyllabification, (b)adjacent context, (c) semantic integrity, and (d) frequency of co-occurence of a pair of verb and resultative. The author also addresses a series of grammatical changes and innovations caused by the formation of this resultative construction, such as the development of aspect, mood, verb reduplication, the new predicate structure, the disposal construction, the passive construction, the verb copying construction, and the new topicalization construction, all of which together shape the grammatical system of Modern Chinese. The present analysis raises and discusses a number of theoretical issues that are meaningful to various linguistic disciplines like pragmatics, discourse analysis, grammaticalization, and general historical linguistics.},

The second section focuses on statistical approaches in natural language processing. In the final section of the book, each chapter describes a particular class of application, from Chinese machine translation to information visualization to ontology construction to biomedical text mining. Fully updated with the latest developments in the field, this comprehensive, modern handbook emphasizes how to implement practical language processing tools in computational systems.},

representation from arbitrary or unintended use. It provides a protective covering that hides the underlying
representation and constrains the way objects may interact with other objects. In an untyped system untyped
objects are naked in that the underlying representation is exposed for all to see. Violating the type system
involves removing the protective set of clothing and operating directly on the naked representation.
Objects of a given type have a representation that respects the expected properties of the data type."},
