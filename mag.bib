The author also addresses a series of grammatical changes and innovations caused by the formation of this resultative construction, such as the development of aspect, mood, verb reduplication, the new predicate structure, the disposal construction, the passive construction, the verb copying construction, and the new topicalization construction, all of which together shape the grammatical system of Modern Chinese. The present analysis raises and discusses a number of theoretical issues that are meaningful to various linguistic disciplines like pragmatics, discourse analysis, grammaticalization, and general historical linguistics.},

The main emphasis of this series is on self-contained monographs covering particular areas of recent research and surveys of methods, problems, and results in all fields of inquiry where recourse to logical analysis and logical methods has been fruitful. {INDICES} will contain monographs dealing with the central areas of philosophical logic (extensional and intensional systems, indexical logics, non-classical logics, philosophy of logic, etc.) as well as studies in which these systems are applied to specific issues in philosophy, in the formal semantics of natural languages, the foundations of linguistic theory, in computational linguistics, and in theoretical computer science. Constructive type theory was first presented in 1970, by the Swedish logician Per Martin-Lof. It has become one of the main approaches used in the foundations of mathematics and computer science. But it has remained relatively unknown among linguists and philosophers, although it provides a considerable extension of the concepts and techniques of logic. The book first gives an introduction to type theory from the point of view of linguistics and the philosophy of language. Type theory is then applied in the areas of quantification, anaphora, temporal reference, and the structure of text and discourse. By virtue of the type-theoretical concepts of proof object and context, various phenomena of dependence and progression in language can be discussed in precise terms, and several well-known problems can be solved. A categorial grammar is presented togenerate formally a fragment of English, together with an example of a computer implementation.},

	abstract = {Grammatical Framework ({GF}) is a special-purpose functional language for defining grammars. It uses a Logical Framework ({LF}) for a description of abstract syntax, and adds to this a notation for defining concrete syntax. {GF} grammars themselves are purely declarative, but can be used both for linearizing syntax trees and parsing strings. {GF} can describe both formal and natural languages. The key notion of this description is a grammatical object, which is not just a string, but a record that contains all information on inflection and inherent grammatical features such as number and gender in natural languages, or precedence in formal languages. Grammatical objects have a type system, which helps to eliminate run-time errors in language processing. In the same way as a {LF}, {GF} uses dependent types in abstract syntax to express semantic conditions, such as well-typedness and proof obligations. Multilingual grammars, where one abstract syntax has many parallel concrete syntaxes, can be used for reliable and meaning-preserving translation. They can also be used in authoring systems, where syntax trees are constructed in an interactive editor similar to proof editors based on {LF}. While being edited, the trees can simultaneously be viewed in different languages. This paper starts with a gradual introduction to {GF}, going through a sequence of simpler formalisms till the full power is reached. The introduction is followed by a systematic presentation of the {GF} formalism and outlines of the main algorithms: partial evaluation and parser generation. The paper concludes by brief discussions of the Haskell implementation of {GF}, existing applications, and related work.},

	abstract = {A Systran {MT} server became available on the minitel network in 1984, and on Internet in 1994. Since then we have come to a better understanding of the nature of {MT} systems by separately analyzing their linguistic, computational, and operational architectures. Also, thanks to the {CxAxQ} metatheorem, the systems' inherent limits have been clarified, and design choices can now be made in an informed manner according to the translation situations. {MT} evaluation has also matured: tools based on reference translations are useful for measuring progress; those based on subjective judgments for estimating future usage quality; and task-related objective measures (such as post-editing distances) for measuring operational quality. Moreover, the same technological advances that have led to “Web 2.0” have brought several futuristic predictions to fruition. Free Web {MT} services have democratized assimilation {MT} beyond belief. Speech translation research has given rise to usable systems for restricted tasks running on {PDAs} or on mobile phones connected to servers. New man-machine interface techniques have made interactive disambiguation usable in large-coverage multimodal {MT}. Increases in computing power have made statistical methods workable, and have led to the possibility of building low-linguistic-quality but still useful {MT} systems by machine learning from aligned bilingual corpora ({SMT}, {EBMT}). In parallel, progress has been made in developing interlingua-based {MT} systems, using hybrid methods. Unfortunately, many misconceptions about {MT} have spread among the public, and even among {MT} researchers, because of ignorance of the past and present of {MT} R\&D. A compensating factor is the willingness of end users to freely contribute to building essential parts of the linguistic knowledge needed to construct {MT} systems, whether corpus-related or lexical. Finally, some developments we anticipated fifteen years ago have not yet materialized, such as online writing - - tools equipped with interactive disambiguation, and as a corollary the possibility of transforming source documents into self-explaining documents ({SEDs}) and of producing corresponding {SEDs} fully automatically in several target languages. These visions should now be realized, thanks to the evolution of Web programming and multilingual {NLP} techniques, leading towards a true Semantic Web, “Web 3.0”, which will support ubilingual (ubiquitous multilingual) computing.},

	abstract = {Chinese, as an aspect language, has played an important role in the development of aspect theory. This book is a systematic and structured exploration of the linguistic devices that Mandarin Chinese employs to express aspectual meanings. The work presented here is the first corpus-based account of aspect in Chinese, encompassing both situation aspect and viewpoint aspect. In using corpus data, the book seeks to achieve a marriage between theory-driven and corpus-based approaches to linguistics. The corpus-based model presented explores aspect at both the semantic and grammatical levels. At the semantic level a two-level model of situation aspect is proposed, which covers both the lexical and sentential levels, thus giving a better account of the compositional nature of situation aspect. At the grammatical level four perfective and four imperfective aspects in Chinese are explored in detail. This exploration corrects many intuition-based misconceptions, and associated misleading conclusions, about aspect in Chinese common in the literature.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Grammatical Framework {GF} is a grammar formalism designed for multilingual grammars. A multilingual grammar has a shared representation, called abstract syntax, and a set of concrete syntaxes that map the abstract syntax to different languages. A {GF} grammar consists of modules, which can share code through inheritance, but which can also hide information to achieve division of labour between grammarians working on different modules. The goal is to make it possible for linguistically untrained programmers to write linguistically correct application grammars encoding the semantics of special domains. Such programmers can rely on resource grammars, written by linguists, which play the rôle of standard libraries. Application grammarians use resource grammars through abstract interfaces, and the type system of {GF} guarantees that grammaticality is preserved. The ongoing {GF} resource grammar project provides resource grammars for ten languages. In addition to their use as libraries, resource grammars serve as an experiment showing how much grammar code can be shared between different languages. 1.1. Multilingual grammars 1.},

	abstract = {Grammatical Framework ({GF}) is a well known theoretical framework and a mature programming language for the description of natural languages. The {GF} community is growing rapidly and the range of applications is expanding. Within the framework, there are computational resources for 26 languages created from different people in different organizations. The coverage of the different resources varies but there are complete morphologies and grammars for at least 20 languages. This advancement would not be possible without the continuous development of the {GF} compiler and interpreter. The demand for efficient and portable execution model for {GF} has led to major changes in both the compiler and the interpreter. We developed a new low-level representation called Portable Grammar Format ({PGF}) which is simple enough for an efficient interpretation. Since it was already known that a major fragment of {GF} is equivalent to Parallel Multiple Context-Free Grammar ({PMCFG}), we designed {PGF} as an extension that adds to {PMCFG} distinctive features of {GF} such as multilingualism, higher-order abstract syntax, dependent types, etc. In the process we developed novel algorithms for parsing and linearization with {PMCFG} and a framework for logical reasoning in first-order type theory where the proof search can be constrained by the parse chart. This monograph is the detailed description of the engine for efficient interpretation of {PGF} and is intended as a reference for building alternative implementations and as a foundation for the future development of {PGF}.},

Ein Programm ist nur dann brauchbar, wenn es das gestellte Problem korrekt löst, und dies darüber hinaus mit der gewünschten Effizienz tut. Aussagen über die Korrektheit und Effizienz eines Programms sind nur dann möglich, wenn die verwendete Programmiersprache exakt definiert ist, d.h., wenn die Menge der Pro gramme (Syntax) und deren Bedeutung (Semantik) festliegen. Die Definition von Syntax und Semantik nimmt daher in diesem Buch einen wichtigen Platz ein. For male Definitionen werden erst dann lebendig, wenn sie auf einem guten intuitiven Verständnis aufbauen, und wenn sie zu Folgerungen in der Form von Sätzen führen. Daher enthält dieses Buch eine große Anzahl von Beispielen, Sätzen und Aufgaben. Die Grundlagen der Programmiersprachen werden eingeführt anhand einer spezifischen Programmiersprache, {PROSA} genannt ({PROgrammiersprache} {SAar} brücken). {PROSA} ist der Programmiersprache Pascal sehr ähnlich, weicht aber in einigen Punkten (z.B. dynamische Felder, geschachtelte Verbunde) aus didaktischen Gründen ab.

	abstract = {The study of formal languages and of related families of automata has long been at the core of theoretical computer science. Until recently, the main reasons for this centrality were connected with the specification and analy sis of programming languages, which led naturally to the following ques tions. How might a grammar be written for such a language? How could we check whether a text were or were not a well-formed program generated by that grammar? How could we parse a program to provide the structural analysis needed by a compiler? How could we check for ambiguity to en sure that a program has a unique analysis to be passed to the computer? This focus on programming languages has now been broadened by the in creasing concern of computer scientists with designing interfaces which allow humans to communicate with computers in a natural language, at least concerning problems in some well-delimited domain of discourse. The necessary work in computational linguistics draws on studies both within linguistics (the analysis of human languages) and within artificial intelligence. The present volume is the first textbook to combine the topics of formal language theory traditionally taught in the context of program ming languages with an introduction to issues in computational linguistics. It is one of a series, The {AKM} Series in Theoretical Computer Science, designed to make key mathematical developments in computer science readily accessible to undergraduate and beginning graduate students.},

	url = {http://www.molto-project.eu/sites/default/files/uwngf.pdf},
	abstract = {Machine translation using the Grammatical Framework ({GF}) was originally developed for controlled languages with well-defined abstract semantics that acts as an interlingua. More recently, the coverage of {GF} resource grammars and its processing capabilities have reached to a level, where open-domain tasks such as arbitrary text parsing and translation look a possibility. But, we need several new advances, including robust parsing, parse- tree disambiguation, word sense disambiguation ({WSD}), and wide-coverage interlingual lexicons. In this paper, we address the later two issues. First, we build a wide coverage interlingual translation lexicon using the Princeton and Universal {WordNet} data. Then, we propose a technique to do {WSD} in {GF}, by integrating an existing {WSD} tool and replacing the usual {GF} style lexicons, which give one target word for each source word, by the reported {WordNet} based lexicons. The result is that, with the help of these new lexicons and {WSD}, the quality of translations improves in most of the cases, as we show by examples. Both {WSD} in general, and {WordNets} are of course well known, but this is the first time these tools have been coupled with {GF}.},

Part B is carefully organized around language functions and notions such as:     Communication strategies Making comparisons Giving and seeking information Expressing apologies, regrets and sympathies   The two parts of the Grammar are closely linked by extensive cross-references, providing a grammatical and functional perspective on many patterns. All grammar points and functions are richly illustrated with examples, with a strong focus on contemporary usage.  Main features of the grammar include:     Examples given in simplified characters, traditional characters and romanization (pinyin) Clear explanations and accessible descriptions Particular attention to areas of particular difficulty for learners of Mandarin Chinese    Implementing feedback from users of the first edition of the Grammar, this second edition has been revised throughout to offer expanded explanations, examples, cross-referencing, and indexing and brand new chapters on aspect, resultative verbs, directional verbs and "ba" sentences.  This is the ideal reference grammar for learners of Mandarin Chinese at all levels, from elementary to advanced. No prior knowledge of grammatical terminology is assumed and a glossary of grammatical terms is provided. This Grammar is accompanied by the Modern Mandarin Chinese Grammar Workbook (978-0-415-83488-9; available for separate purchase) which features related exercises and activities.},
